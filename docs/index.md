Hey! I'm Rennan Cockles 👋

I'm a software/data engineer from Brazil. 🇧🇷

I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering with emphasis on computational modeling by the State University of Rio de Janeiro (UERJ). 👨‍🎓

I currently work as a specialist data engineer at <a href="https://wittel.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Wittel</a> and <a href="https://blueorange.digital" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Blue Orange</a> 👨‍💼

I have more than 10 years of experience in several technology areas such as software engineer, data engineer, artificial intelligence and infrastructure. 👨‍💻

I love to solve problems and like to think that there is always a simple solution to them and usually automating is one of them. 🤓

I like to build things with Machine Learning/Deep Learning, Docker, Bash Script, Python, NodeJS, VueJS, TypeScript (and JavaScript) and modern backend APIs. 👊
