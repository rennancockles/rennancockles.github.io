Hey! I’m Rennan Cockles 👋

I’m a software and machine learning engineer from Brazil. 🇧🇷

I hold a bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering with an emphasis on Computational Modeling from the State University of Rio de Janeiro (UERJ). 👨‍🎓

Currently, I work as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Blue Orange. 👨‍💼

I have over 10 years of experience in various technology domains, including software engineering, data engineering, machine learning, genai, cloud and infrastructure. 👨‍💻

I love solving problems and believe that there’s always a simple solution — often through automation. 🤓

I enjoy building things with Machine Learning, GenAI, Docker, Bash, Python, and modern backend APIs. 👊
